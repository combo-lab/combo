# Overview

Combo, a traditional web framework, with optional modern frontend practices.

> Combo is a fork of [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix). But unlike Phoenix, it aims to:
>
> - include all related projects within a single unified codebase.
> - decouple from the [phoenix_live_view](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).
> - integrate with modern frontend practices.
