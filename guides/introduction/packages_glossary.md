  regular request-response life-cycle.
- [ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto) - a language integrated query and database
  wrapper.
- [combo_ecto](https://hex.pm/packages/combo_ecto) - plugs and protocol
  implementations for using combo with ecto.

  localization through [`gettext`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).
